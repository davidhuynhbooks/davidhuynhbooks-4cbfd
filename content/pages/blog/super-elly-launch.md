## Launching this week!

Super Elly and The Mystery of the Missing Broccoli is launching this week!  This has been quite an endeavor to put this book together.  I hope you all enjoy it.  The story is longer, the visuals are more vibrant.  A lot of learning and care went into this followup to *Why is Elly Covered in Jelly?*

Similar to *Why is Elly Covered in Jelly?* - *Super Elly* takes a traditionally adult concept in 5S and translates it into a children's story that is fun and accessible to all ages.
