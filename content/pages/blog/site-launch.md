## Here it is.

The last time I seriously worked on a website was probably 2003.  I was using Macromedia Flash, and CSS was a new thing.  Things sure have advanced in that time.  I suppose I could I have used something like Wix, Wordpress, or Squarespace... but I was drawn to Stackbit to make a Jamstack website for some reason.

This aggregates much of the content that I post across social media, and is accessible to those not on a social network.

Let me know what you think!
