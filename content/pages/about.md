      I graduated from the University of Texas at Dallas with a B.S. in Computer
      Science and an M.S. in Information Technology Management. I am
      professionally certified in several areas of project management and lean
      six sigma.  I have spent my career integrating people, process, and
      technology and I am know translating that experience into funny and
      accessible books that parents and children love to read.  Writing
      children's books combines my passions of family, creativity, learning, and
      problem solving.


      Every book read supports my goal of promoting children's literacy and
      education.


      I live in Dallas, TX with my wife and two daughters.  My youngest
      daughter, Elly, is the inspiration for these stories.  I have learned more
      from her than any book or class.  Seeing the world from her eyes fills
      each day with joy and possibility.
