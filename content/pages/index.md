    title: Children's books by David Huynh
    content: >
      Hi! I write children's books that promote creative thinking and problem
      solving. Did you know that children who are taught problem solving skills
      are smarter, more independent, and more creative? **It's true!** Did you
      also know that everyone, including children, learn more readily when they
      are happy?  **That's true, too!**


      My books are funny and educational, with the full intention of making
      children and parents happy while learning tools to solve problems better.

          David is a master of process management, and this simple format of a
          kids book gets the point of "5 whys" across better than any expert
          authors.
