      Creative thinking and problem solving are such important skills to develop
      and it is as simple as nurturing curiosity and learning to ask why.
      Children that are taught creative thinking skills become smarter, more
      independent, and more creative.


      With this book children of all ages can easily learn the 5 Why technique
      that has been used for decades in Fortune 500 organizations, in a fun
      story with beautiful illustrations. The 5 Why technique was created by
      Sakichi Toyoda and was famously used within the Toyota Motor Corporation.
      This is a foundational concept that is now widely used in Lean, Six Sigma,
      and Agile teams to understand problems and find solutions.

      book that parents and children both love to read, with a very funny story
