      Early Childhood Education and Children's Asia & Asian America Stories!


      *Creative thinking and problem solving are such important skills to
      develop and it is as simple as nurturing curiosity and learning to ask
      why. Children that are taught creative thinking skills become smarter,
      more independent, and more creative.*

      that has been used for decades in Fortune 500 organizations, in a fun

      Sakichi Toyoda and was famously used within the Toyota Motor Corporation.
      This is a foundational concept that is now widely used in Lean, Six Sigma,
      and Agile teams to understand problems and find solutions.*
